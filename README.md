### App Description
App fetches data from the Internet with the help of Retrofit2 library. App allows a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it. The recipe listing is located [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/May/59121517_baking/baking.json).

The JSON file contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos and images that need to be displayed. 
This projects demonstrates a situation that professional developers often experience - how to handle unexpected input in an data.


## What I Learned

- Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
- Handle error cases in Android.
- Add a widget to app experience.
- Leverage a third-party library.
- Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
- Application makes use of Espresso to test aspects of the UI.
